# Pepper Static Site Generator

Python powered static site generator, an inferior version of Hugo.

You probably shouldn't use this. Seriously, I did this semi as a joke but it turned out to be funner to do that I initially thought.

If you are set on using this for whatever reasons, some good things:

* Its Python! 
* Doesn't require external dependencies like Hugo
* Uses Jinja2 as the template engine
* I've built this using the markdown files for my Hugo blog, so it's more or less plug and play
